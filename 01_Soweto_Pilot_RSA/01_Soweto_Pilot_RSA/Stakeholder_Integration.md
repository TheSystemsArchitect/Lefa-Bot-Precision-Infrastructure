🤝 Multi-Stakeholder Ecosystem & Data Governance
Project Phase: 01 - Soweto Pilot
Governance Model: IKS-Academic-Farmer-State Collaboration
1. The Collaborative Data Pipeline
The Lefa-Bot architecture is not a closed loop; it relies on a "Triangulation" of data from four distinct stakeholder groups to ensure Scientific Rigor and Cultural Authenticity.
A. Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) - The Sangomas
Role: Providing "Natural Proxies" (e.g., indicator species, insect behavior, lunar cycles).
Data Entry: Qualitative observations are tagged in the SQL database to correlate with sensor spikes.
Impact: Ensures the technology respects and preserves traditional South African agricultural wisdom.
B. Scientific & Academic Partners (Wits, UJ, SMU)
Role: Ground Truth Validation.
Data Contribution: Universities provide high-precision lab analysis (HPLC) of THC levels to calibrate the Lefa-Bot's "Proxy" predictions.
Impact: Gives the project the academic "Peer-Reviewed" status required for international export.
C. Regulatory & State Bodies (DALRRD, SAPS, SETAs)
Role: Oversight and Certification.
Data Usage: Accessing the "Compliance Clock" dashboard to verify the 0.2% THC threshold is maintained 24/7.
Impact: Lowers the cost of policing and legal risk for the farmer.
D. The Farmers & Funda Community College
Role: Operational Implementation.
Data Usage: Real-time smartphone alerts for irrigation and shading.
Impact: Economic empowerment and skill development in 4IR agriculture.
2. Governance & Data Ownership
To protect all participants, the project utilizes a Joint Data Ownership Agreement:
Anonymization: Farm locations are masked in public research to prevent "Bio-Piracy."
Benefit Sharing: Any commercialized insights from IKS are governed by a profit-sharing model (see 03_Banking_Financial_Layer).
